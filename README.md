# SpanishGenerator

The purpose of this program is to generate a random combination of verbs, nouns, and adjectives from a given list which is combined with a random mood/tense/pronoun combination for the user to create a sentence/sentences from.
This is to help with sentence creation and recognition of words by using them.
The SM2 spaced repetition algorithm is used for spacing when words will be seen again.

### Future updates:
